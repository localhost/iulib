iulib - the image understanding library
http://code.google.com/p/iulib/

Version 0.4 (2008-05-01)

The packages you need to install iulib are listed in ubuntu-packages.

On Ubuntu 9.04, you can install with:

    scons
    sudo scons install

On other platforms, you can install with

    ./build
    make
    sudo make install
    
Tests are intended for developers and porters. You do not need to run them
if you are just intending to use iulib.  To run the tests, use:

    make check
    
If you get errors relating to "convert" not being found, you may need to
install the ImageMagick tools.

In order to clean the iulib folder, i.e. remove all compiled files, run:

    make clean
    
In order to remove all files installed with 'make install' run:

    make uninstall

or run

    sudo ./uninstall

(These do slightly different things.)
